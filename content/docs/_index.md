## Purpose/Rationale

The impact of digital writing technologies is apparent across the globe. From the telecommunication technologies in orbit above our heads and moored below us on the ocean floors to the myriad of subscription cloud-based software at our fingertips, there are few places left where such technologies have not leaked into our everyday practices. Moreover, personal digital writing technologies, with the exception of a few writing peripherals and power adapters, are more globally and universally alike than perhaps any other technology ever. At first glance, this wide adoption suggests that few things could be more mundane than our writing technologies. Yet, beneath and, at times, even upon the surfaces of these technologies are the traces of ideological leaks directing their uses and enculturation. 

Weird and Wired articulates a theory for how hegemonic digital literacy standards and norms are sedimented and enforced through technologies, material infrastructures, and the social circulation of digital writing. Weird and Wired provides a framework for understanding the seemingly mundane choices that undergird contemporary digital writing practices and offers a way to bridge cultural and material critiques of digital writing. In other words, this book provides a method for understanding which digital features are the result of WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic) design ideologies and how such features are reified and sedimented hard(wired) values within the composing technologies and the physical and social infrastructures themselves. This book draws attention to these wired practices to enable the possibility of friction to interrupt and critique the WEIRD ideologies, especially through a practice of self-critique that I call vigilant design justification. 

To accomplish these goals, I use transdisciplinary methods to examine the relationships between machines, infrastructures, and cultures. My methods are drawn from several homes outside of Composition and Rhetoric. I’ll touch on a few notable intersections below. First, this project draws heavily on theories of Activity Systems (Castells, 1996; Castells, Linchuan Qui, Fernandez-Ardevol, & Sey, 2007; Prior & Shipka, 2003). This approach to Activity Systems enables me to ground relationships between people, materials, and design values. For instance, in Chapter 1, I use an Activity Systems analysis to trace the emergence of “white space” or “negative space” as a design value as it relates to new affordances in printing. In brief, when material (Ink/Paper) costs outweighed labor costs (especially typesetting) it became stylish and en-vogue to make less use of the available paper/screen space. A second disciplinary home is apparent through the framework of WEIRD which is built out of cultural and educational psychology (Henrich 2008; Henrich et al. 2010). This approach enables my analysis to remain diffractive in practice. For instance, understanding white space as a WEIRD practice resists labeling the practice as merely “more legible” or “more attractive” and instead allows me to critique the practice as part of a Western and Rich culture of conspicuous consumption. Such conspicuous consumption and opulence, I further argue, continue this day in practices of “digital maximalism”. Finally, this project is heavily influenced by work in Media theory. I have especially drawn inspiration from material and technical studies of media such as Harwood’s (2011) *The Interface: IBM and the transformation of corporate design*, 1945-1976,  Starosielski’s (2015) *The Undersea network*, and Clark’s (2018) *Designing an internet*. Such careful studies illustrate that digital composing practices are not merely inert consequences of emerging technology but often tied to economic, extractive, and nationalist projects. As Rhetoricians and Compositionists who are often the bleeding-edge advocates of digital writing, we have a responsibility to engage such technologies, ideologies, and pedagogies with extreme care.

## Similar books

This project overlaps several theoretical areas in digital Rhetoric and Composition Studies and subsequently draws parallels to many other monographs. In the most immediate sense, this project builds from Douglas Eyman’s (2015) Digital Rhetoric which has been especially important in delineating and defining a field of study both of digital as Rhetorical and Rhetoric as digital. Hodgson’s (2019) Post-digital Rhetoric and the New Aesthetic is a more recent monograph that applies a different framework to understanding rhetoric as “post-digital” especially in regard to the ever-blurring line between digital and real. Nevertheless, my project differs significantly in scope and direction from these two books. While the project of Eyman’s Digital Rhetoric was, broadly, to create a framework for understanding digital as Rhetoric (and Rhetoric as digital) and Hodgson’s project has been to point toward the digital/real boundaries and the value of Western canonical rhetoric for understanding such boundaries, my project explores the inundating properties of contemporary digital production and circulation. Such inundation is an attribute of technological and cultural hegemony, or to put it bluntly, forces of digital colonialism (Kwet, 2018). 

As an exploration of digital colonialism, this project also extends a recent turn toward the materiality of digital work. Such materiality and media can be found in books such as The *Undersea Network* (Starosielski, 2015), *A Geology of Media* (Parikka, 2015) and *The Digital Environment* (Boczkowski & Mitchelstein, 2021). Additionally, my project methodologically intersects with socio-theoretical frameworks present in books such as *Information Please* (Poster, 2006), *Parallel Minds* (Tripaldi, 2022), and especially *Technology of the Oppressed* (Nemer, 2022). Nevertheless, this project differs from these other works in two significant ways. While the overall scope of this book extends critiques of digital design values and digital materiality relationships, this book uses a new framework of leakage to articulate these relationships. This concept of leakage embraces contingency for the conditions and mechanisms of how leakages occur. Second, this book extends these critiques from ideology and materials into policy, pedagogy, and design practices – such avenues present new frictions to work against the grain of digital maximalism and digital colonialism.

Finally, there are several texts that overlap in subject focus that need mentioning here. In particular, I suspect readers of the below texts would find interest in Weird and Wired: 

1. The Digital Nonhumanities (Reid, 2022)
2. Are We There Yet? Computers and the teaching of writing (Marlow & Purdy, 2021)
3. Writing Workflows: Beyond word processing (Lockridge & Van Ittersum, 2020)
5. The Digital Environment: How we live, learn, work, and play now (Boczkowski & Mitchelstein, 2021)
6. How Artifacts Afford: The power and politics of everyday things (Davis, 2020)
7. Reading Writing Interfaces: From the digital to the bookbound (Emerson, 2014)

## Audience & Contributions

### Audience
The primary audiences for the book are educators, scholars, and practitioners of digital literacy, digital rhetoric, multimodal composition, or web design. This book would be used in graduate seminars and upper-level undergraduate courses in all these fields. Additionally, there are educational and technological policy considerations that would find traction more broadly in fields of education in Learning Technologies / Instructional Technologies graduate programs as well as digital design implications that will be compelling to graphic design theory. There is, finally, an international readership in digital writing and, especially, literacy studies that are likely to find interest in this book as it relates to writing, reading, and designing across global borders and in conjunction with emerging global digital literacy policies.

Given the myriad of audiences, I am seeking publication with Sweetland DRC particularly because of your commitment to Open-Access.

  
### Contributions to the field

I want to take particular care in outlining the contributions I see this project contributing to the readers. I am writing this book, especially toward the following contributions for Rhetoric and Composition scholars:
  
1. **WEIRD**: This book introduces the interdisciplinary conversation of WEIRD bias to digital rhetoric and especially toward technological design. Despite holding less than 17% of the world’s “online population”, the top five most visited websites are based in the United States. Weird and Wired argues that this points toward a technological and cultural hegemony that is “naturalized” through many of our devices and, at worst, ignored by contemporary pedagogies. 
2. **Materializing Digital Practices**: This book theorizes digital practices alongside material and social infrastructures & devices by drawing a clear connection between WEIRD principles and the hardwired designs that continually reinforces these principles. Many of these hardwired designs are physically wired (read: technological devices); however, I argue that others are based in educational and cultural export. For instance, global strategic initiatives that frame digital access as participation in Western economies and consumption. 
3. **Methods for Self-Critique**: This book introduces a method of self-critique called “vigilant design justification” - in the introduction section  “Design Justification” I model this method of self-critique by openly discussing and justifying the design choices made in preparation for this work. In the penultimate chapter, I provide a more robust framework with a series of questions, prompts, and suggestions for future design justifications. Additionally, in this penultimate chapter I provide an assignment sequence for integrating design justifications into our curriculum.

## Suitability to the press

I am exclusively submitting this proposal to the Sweetland Digital Rhetoric Collaborative Book Series because I believe the argument and design of this born-digital book align especially with the mission of your publishing house in three particular ways: 

1. The content area of the book focuses on the Rhetorical/Compositional implications of new, and seemingly ubiquitous, technologies especially as related to global digital writing. This book will contribute to the Sweetland DRC’s line of texts that similarly take up ambitiously large projects such Palmeri & McCorkle’s (2021) 100 Years or new media pedagogy, Laura Gonzales’s (2016) Sites of translation. This text is especially framed toward the context of Digital Rhetoric/Composition pedagogies and draws heavily from such scholarship in my work in chapters 1 and 2. 
2. The technological structure of the book is an innovative approach to digital publishing. By foregrounding a low-bandwidth design for the webtext, this project provides a heuristic for re-thinking digital writing against the grain of contemporary “digital maximalism” that venerates increasingly high-fidelity and computationally dense digital writing.  
3. Finally, this book contributes to larger trends in the field of critique of contemporary insistence on norms based in the global north / western hemispheres. Weird & Wired offers a compelling critique that digital writing pedagogies and technologies remain involved in the continuation of digital colonialism and offers several methods of digital decolonization.  
# Chapter Summaries

- **Introduction**
    The introduction chapter offers an exigency for the project by discussing the global implications of digital writing. I favor moving quickly to establish a global landscape of digital literacy rather than a robust engagement with field specific definitions of digital literacy, which I flesh out in the next chapter, to enable non-rhetorician readership. Next, I give a summary of each chapter and I establish our place as digital educators as a place of possibilities and optimism. Following this I play on the concept of “artist statement” in the form of a design justification. It is striking that very few of our digital projects include an artist statement, afterall, what is digital composing if not, among other things, mixed-media art? In my statement “design justification” I give a justification that articulates my reasons behind the peculiar design choices I have taken in this book. Here I give both the ideological reasons for adopting a lightweight and low-bandwidth design alongside the technical resources for future designers inspired to adopt this approach. 


- **Chapter 1 WEIRD by design**
    In chapter 1, I articulate a framework for understanding, historizing, and critiquing contemporary digital practices as WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic). Beginning with a survey of digital rhetoric and digital writing scholarship I argue that what counts as good digital writing is, from a global perspective, shaped heavily by WEIRD practices and values. Here I summarize cultural and educational concepts of WEIRD and I argue that our participation in these values continue to strengthen their hold. To build off this framework, I conduct an Activity Systems analysis of status quo digital design values. I offer extended examinations of such values (e.g. opulence, user-data fetishization) coded into our literacies like white space, CARP, UX, and digital expediency. In particular, these examinations demonstrate the sheer depth to which WEIRD values penetrate our digital writing practices. Concluding the chapter, I suggest a model of using this framework to identify and revise hegemonic digital values.


- **Chapter 2 WIRED by extension**
    In Chapter 2, I explore how WEIRD design ideologies become hard(wired) when the materials, software, and institutions galvanize these very communication practices. Here I examine information architecture, digital writing technologies, and digital literacy polices to establish three emergent forms that wire our WEIRD practices. These are, respectively, a rationalist bias toward control and enclosure, a functionalist bias of achievement and results, and an economic bias toward participation/extraction. In concluding this chapter I argue for repositioning research on digital affordances into digital leakages. Leakage is drawn from electronics and computer examples of “electrical leak” and “data leak” to imply places where a seemingly closed system trickle into their environment (or where the environment trickles into the system).To put it plainly, I suggest rather than focus on how technology enables and constrains us we should, instead, focus on how technology extracts from us and leaks into us.   


- **Chapter 3 Tracing The Leakage: Policies, Pedagogies, Practices** 
    This chapter fleshes out the concept of leakage. Drawing off Davis’ (2020) mechanisms and conditions approach to affordances, I outline the conditions under which leakages happen and the mechanisms for how leakages occur. After establishing this framework, I conduct an analyses using this leakage framework. First I examine several Digital Literacy Initiatives that frame Digital Literacy as an emerging lingua franca. In particular, I analyze initiatives that dovetail with the United Nations Roadmap For Digital Cooperation - an ambitious international policy that aspires to connect every adult on the planet with accessible and affordable internet access. While there is much to applaud in such an ambitious goal, I focus critiques toward primarily economic proposals (e.g. International Finance Corporation) in sub-saharan Africa. Such initiatives suggest and offer wide-scale digital adoption but often imply cultural adaption. Here, in particular, I demonstrate how the WEIRD and wired values of digital hegemony actively leak into transcontinental contexts. Following this policy analysis, I conduct an analysis of digital literacy pedagogies.I have tentatively arranged interviews with digital literacy educators at two institutions, one in Hong Kong and one in Japan, to conduct focused interviews on digital pedagogies. In particular, I focus on the oversaturation of Western design values embedded in the de facto global design audiences. Finally, drawing off previous fieldwork in a multimedia suite I analyze the design practices of emerging digital professionals and, especially, their relationships with software tools. For many, these tools offer convenient and semi-automated workflows that quickly replicate dominant paradigms. 


- **Chapter 4 For a Vigilant Justification** 
    In Chapter 4 I argue for a disposition of vigilant design justification through self-critique of our work. I offer my own self-critique before moving to provide a framework for classes and future publication. In particular, I extend an argument for embracing minimalist design and maximalist justification.

  

- **Chapter 5 Conclusion**
    Chapter 5 finishes the book with a call to anticipate and accommodate, rather than resist, leakage. Technologies will, undeniably, continue to be shaped by and actively shape global cultures and economies. Yet, technology that is further blackboxed and enclosed – to limit their leakages – exacerbates digital divides. Instead, my call to action is not to insulate against but to more carefully accommodate for these leakages and, in the right circumstances, encourage  new directions of flow and self-determination. 

  

## Proposed Length

The total proposed length of this book is 55,000 words and ~100 low-bandwidth dithered images. 

## Sustainability & Feasibility 

The book is designed to be a webtext and downloadable PDF. These design choices are made to increase the long-term sustainability of the text, especially with regard to open access and energy costs. In particular, I’m designing the book to require very low bandwidth (see enclosed “Design Justification” for a more in-depth discussion on this topic) that lowers access barriers to global communities that may operate on bandwidth limitations and limits the carbon footprint of the project. The bulk of the text is composed in the open-source, lightweight, future-proof language Markdown and will be converted to HTML by a server-side application / static-site generator (e.g Pelican, Jekyll). This is a one-time conversion and will happen before the final delivery of the project files to the publisher. 

Additionally, the simple design of the text and the use of low-bandwidth images will enable seamless transition to creating a print book in order for the publisher to recoup production costs.

Support for research time is provided by my home institution in the form of a pre-tenure sabbatical course release as well as a release for previously “banked” reassigned time. Additionally, a paid graduate research assistant will help in the final copy-edits and indexing. 

## Timetable for completion (May 2025)

This digital book will be ready for complete peer review by May 2025. I anticipate sending early drafts to colleagues during this time for them to review and consider adopting for their 2025/2026 courses.

- A draft of chapter 1 “WEIRD by Design” was presented to educators in my home institution during Spring 2022.
- A draft version of chapter 3 “Tracing the Leakage” that focuses primarily on global digital literacy policy will be presented at RSA 2024. 
- Draft versions of pedagogical tools in chapter 4 “For a Vigilant Design” have been taught in my Fall 2021/2022 ENGL 3130  course and will be taught during a themed Sustainability & UN Goals ENGL 3130 during Fall 2023.

  

With regard to my tenure timeline. I am on track to apply for Associate Professor in December of 2025. I already exceed my institution’s tenure requirements for teaching, scholarship, and service. It will, nevertheless, give me piece of mind to apply with a book “in-press” or “under review” but I have flexibility to work with reviewers and publishers to produce a strong and compelling text.
