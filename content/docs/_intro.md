>The digital skills challenge in Sub-Saharan Africa is significant, but it is addressable. Whether Ghana and other Sub-Saharan African countries can take advantage of the digital opportunity to become more competitive and prosperous will depend on whether their human capital—their populations’ health, skills, knowledge, experience, and habits—keeps up with this workforce transformation. Digital skills are an essential part of that human capital development and paramount to future success. (International Finance Corporation, 2019)

In 2018 an image of Richard Appiah Akoto, a school teacher in Ghana, went viral on social media. The image depicts him drawing the Microsoft Word interface on a chalkboard to teach the people in his class Information & Communication Technology (ICT) skills. His drawing is remarkably accurate and in his accompanying photos he gives an exhausted look at the camera. Richard’s story circulated quickly in across social media. The story inspired praise for his willingness to go above and beyond, as well as garnered attention toward the impoverished conditions in his school, and prompted Microsoft to donate computers for his class. By all accounts, the story is one of perseverance and accomplishment in the digital age.  

Yet, I find myself coming back to these images when I teach digital writing technologies in my own classes. What I find compelling is that Richard’s images are remarkable for their ability to demonstrate a confluence of global digital literacy issues. First, we have an exigency for privileging ICT education. There are a pantheon of stakeholders that shape educational paradigms to modernize and prepare people for participation in the digital world. Under these definitions, digital skills or digital literacies are rooted primarily in functional aspects of the tools and, indeed, an impetus for his chalkboard drawings is the mandated national exam for students in Ghana that, among other things, tests students’ ICT skills. Driven, in part, by the allure of a modern economy, nations, international organizations, and corporations are heavily invested in the future of a digitally literate human capital. These heavy investments, nevertheless, are not always focused on creating conditions conducive to digital literacy as we might recognize it.    This second issue is the clear digital divide. The chalkboard drawings are, of course, necessitated by the lack of computer hardware in the school. According to later interviews, the last time his school had a working computer was 2011. Now, several years and a working technology lab later, Richard’s school still needs floors and roofing. While the digital divide may have been addressed local conditions remain fragile. Lastly  is the ubiquitous and familiar writing interface: the menu bar at the top, the icons for tools harkening back to their analog ancestors, and the somewhat familiar white font on blue background that reads: Microsoft Word.

Digital writing tools are remarkably similar across the globe and perhaps are more similar to each other than any other technology ever. Aside from a few peripherals and power adapters, most digital writing tools – from their outward appearance down to the inner workings of their code structure – are geographically indistinguishable. [^1] These machines are crafted from raw materials extracted from distant geographies, made from chips and parts produced around the globe, designed in California; assembled in China. And shipped to a store near you. 

Such universality begets a new global literacy; digital literacy, more than Esperanto or English, is poised to be the universal language of the globe. All signs suggest digital connections and literacy initiatives are increasing. In 2020, the United Nations adopted a Roadmap for Digital Cooperation which is a formal policy ensure that every adult on the planet has access to affordable digital networks by 2030. To the UN, access to digital networks dovetails with their 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. These ambitious goals seek to end poverty and hunger, reduce inequality, take climate action, and, among others, grow economies and industries. In more recent policy proposals that are inspired by the Covid-19 pandemic, digital literacy is increasingly poised to provide real-time global data and increased knowledge flow. 

However, when it comes to the most dominant paradigms of digitally (en)circuiting the globe most measures of digital literacy or ICT skills pay much less attention to critical or creative practices. Instead, we get two distinct versions of digital literacy: that is, full-stomach vs empty-belly digitality (Guha & Martinez-Alier, 1997; Mayerl & Best, 2018). In this way, much like the varieties of environmentalism that Guha and Martinez-Alier identified, digital literacy in the global North is implied to focus on creativity, critical thinking, and individual/subjective aesthetic choice. [^2] This starkly contrasts across many of the global agenda setting institutions where digital literacy often stands in as having the functional capabilities to seamlessly participate in global economies (OECD, 2012; Mamedova & Pawlowski, 2018). Digital literacy, in this way, is, at best, a measure of legibility within economic systems (Scribner, 1984) and, at worst, a mode of merely civilizing the world (Ong, 1982). This is starkly contrasted to the more capacious approaches to the (multi)literacies afforded by digital technology (New London Group, 1996, Lankshear & Knobel, 2011; Cope & Kalentis, 2005; 2013, Verhulsdonck & Limbu, 2013). In other words, emerging paradigms of global digital literacy tend to congeal toward a (mono)literacy that privileges seamless integration with the globally rich or overdeveloped nations and networks. [^3] When digital literacy training foregrounds workplace production or mere consumption of pre-existing media it does so at the expense of potentials for creativity. This is particularly evident when we look toward digital artifacts such as webpages that are strikingly similar across the globe. Such similarities point toward forms of hegemonic enculturation and (mono)literacy that prescribe information flows and practices. This is not to suggest the primary driving force of global digital literacy are malicious aims. Nevertheless, it is no secret that the Western world relies on extracting cheap digital labor and virtual migrants provided by such far-away connections (Aneesh, 2006; Kwet, 2018; Altenried, 2022). With this in mind, calls for human capital development through digital literacy skills should raise caution flags. This is a book that hopes to raise such caution flags. 

## The idea of a website, digital writing, and literacy

This book is about digital writing, the pervasiveness of hegemonic digital cultures, and the digital literacy standards tacitly and explicitly enforced on digital writing. There are several ways to slice a definition of digital literacy and digital writing. Throughout this project I adopt three overlapping objects of analysis: 1) digital writing artifacts/compositions, 2) digital writing tools and processes, and 3) digital writing competencies. First, I start with digital writing as artifact. There are no tricks here, I merely mean those which are generally legible on the screen for disparate audiences. [^4]  Informed by Rhetorical Genre Studies (Bawarshi, 2003; Bawarshi & Reiff, 2010; Selfe & Horner, 2013; Gonzales, 2015), I look toward one of the most globally ubiquitous and apparent “born-digital” artifacts: the webpage. With early antecedents to informational pages, the webpage is now metonym for point-of-sale, business directories, newspapers, and more. Nevertheless, websites across the globe and with very few exceptions, abide by a small set of design ideologies that results in a strikingly similar visual monoculture of digital texts. In this way, websites serve as one of the more "Mundane Technologies" of the connected and digital world: that is, sites of potential oppression and resistance (Nemer, 2022).  Secondly, I look toward digital writing tools and activity processes including word processors, image manipulation, code manipulation, and more. Like others in our field, I am particularly drawn toward the materiality and activity/process of digital writing (Wysocki, et al., 2004; Wysocki, 2005; Shipka, 2011, Johnson, 2018). I specifically consider digital writing as a mediated and vital processes rooted across technology, culture, and biology (Kember & Zylinska, 2014). In this way, I look toward how technology seeks to naturalize digital writing processes and outcomes. Finally, I analyze digital writing/literacy as competing forms of assumed competencies tacitly and explicitly enforced by stakeholders and technologies themselves. 

These are not distinct and separate containers, instead, I demonstrate the completeness of their entwining. The circulation and public/s expectations around any digital artifact are deeply vested in and shaped by the presumed competencies, processes, and tools. The seemingly abstract competencies and processes are reified as features of many writing tools with indifference to local conditions. Such a cycle galvanizes an emerging and enduring (mono)culture of digital literacy.   

Throughout this work I’ll take digital writing to mean the myriad of writing that is materialized in contemporary digital technologies and/or accessed through digital sociocultural environments that shape their use. At first glace this may appear expansive. Nevertheless, I limit this endeavor by analyzing digital writing that employs a multitude of “available means” while “remaining true to its foundation in rhetoric” and I’ll add: writing, especially the possibility of writing to endure, circulate, and create bodies or repositories of text/rhetoric, even if such bodies remain tentative (Eyman, 2015, p.30). To be clear, this book does do not examine the rhetorical capabilities of video or sound. Instead, my focus throughout is digital writing that serves to create a corpus of writing/rhetoric. I begin then, with a look toward websites and website design.  Excluded from this endeavor are the many forms of digital ephemera such as blog posts, comment sections, discussion boards (e.g. reddit), or social media. To be fair, such content is increasingly archived and serves as sites for complex cultural work (Sparby, 2017; Gelms 2021) – perhaps making the term digital ephemera an imperfect categorization; yet, these works are primarily constrained by the existing interface of the website and are often supplanted by future content even while they are edited and remade.

The narrowed focus of this book is not to suggest a singular idea of digital, nor is it to imply a hierarchy of importance when it comes to digital writing. Rather, the focus is a methodological choice for a few related reasons. This focus follows from broad category (webpages & web design) to increasingly narrow (tools, policies, pedagogies, and local practices). This structure first demonstrates the scale of digital (mono)literacy before taking aim at specific global and local issues that galvanize and reinforce such a (mono)literacy.  By starting with the ubiquitous, and often strikingly similar, web designs I lay the groundwork for identifying an emerging digital (mono)literacy. Such a (mono)literacy tends toward being synonymous with computer competency. In other words, enacting the requirements of the machine which has been built by and for those with centralized power. Understood this way, such digital (mono)literacy, especially when married with global labor markets, often position marginalized workers as “ the executing body of the software”  – for instance, in the case of Amazon warehouse workers or social content moderators wherein their human body, given its dexterity or visual capabilities, becomes an extensions of the algorithmic efficiency program (Altenried, 2022, p.40). My goal here is to push back against such a conception of literacy as mere competency or ability to execute machine goals. Instead, I foreground a paradigm of global digital literacy that stresses creativity and self-determination; a global digital literacy based on critical consciousness and creativity rather than consumption and colonialism. 

## Natural Devices / Unnatural Destinies 

In presenting a refiguring of global digital literacy, this book begins with assumptions about literacy and, especially, writing. At the forefront of my assumptions is that writing is a creative practice; like all creative practices to have come before it, writing is deeply rooted in social and technological issues. Scholarship has often explored these digital literacies as creative practice embedded within the sociological and technological (Cope & Kalentis, 2005; 2013; Wysocki, 2005; Leander & Boldt 2012; Williams, 2018). Of course, the skills or competencies of a literate practice are not immune to the pressure to adopt social frames.  For instance, research on early activities of writing and drawing have demonstrated colonial logics of enclosure to natural and human subjects (Bleichmar, 2012). Nevertheless, the development of emerging tools offers possibility of cultural change. Bourdieu’s (2017) analysis of Manet’s “symbolic revolution” illustrates well how shifting technologies and the rejection of certain political apparatuses shaped emerging styles and future forms (Bourdieu, 2017).

I want to point out that such social and technological overlaps are especially compounded in digital environments. Digitality, across many forms, has openly embraced an ethos of “naturalization” in the texts and technologies. Through technologies, we have examples like John Harwood’s (2016) history of IBM and the emergence of a home computer that illustrates how technologists worked to naturalize computer hardware by designing toward existing Western interior design trends and as well as decades of corporate films and exhibits such as Mathematica, A Computer Perspective, and The Computer and the Mind of Man. In more contemporary technologies we see this naturalization play out everyday as illustrated by one technologists thoughts: “[h]uman beings are physical creatures; we like to interact directly with objects. We’re simply wired this way” (Safer, 2010). Given the multi-sensory and rhetorical (Carnegie, 2009; Boyle et al., 2018; Voeller, 2019) capabilities of the digital, the naturalization and emerging (mono)literacy of digital technologies is especially concerning and weird.

When the word weird first emerged it signified a control of destiny. Quite literally, the noun form of weird stood in for The Fates. Through time the word evolved to signify uncanny, strange, and perhaps even revolting. It is with both of these historical definitions in mind that I prompt us to think of digital literacy as weird. 

My approach in this project is to examine how digital writing standards, norms, and expectations are sedimented and enforced through technologies, policies, and pedagogies. In this way, digital writing technologies, policies, and pedagogies are weird in the sense they steer the fates of standards and norms. In another sense these standards and norms, I’ll argue, are reflections of a general sense of WEIRDness present in privileged cultures. Extending critiques from Cultural and Educational Psychology, I use the acronym WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic), to critique our tendency to universalize based off a small and over represented subset of global populations. 

The acronym WEIRD is most thoroughly laid out in Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan’s (2010a) article in the journal of Behavioral and Brain Sciences and their subsequent opinion in Nature (2010b). Although this  article was initially focused on experimental psychology, the responses render the concept of WEIRD in a variety of non-experimental research. This is to say that the study of human behavior through anthropological, ethnographic, philosophical, or sociological lenses, has historically had a bias toward WEIRD research, or research that, through theoretical orientation or methodological design, begins with an implied Western, educated, industrialized, rich, democratic standard. To put it simply, methodological designs, such as sampling from undergraduate populations, and theoretical orientations, such as relying on definitional categories from earlier WEIRD scholarship, are inadequate for making claims about complex social human behavior.

While there is scholarship that points toward interfaces that naturalize particular ideologies (Selfe & Selfe, 1994; Zdenck, 2007; Kynard, 2021). The potential for the resulting landscape of digital artifacts to shape perceptions and relationships in the world remains underexplored in scholarship. What impacts are brought about by a monoculture of web design that primarily is influenced by WEIRD assumptions? Where do we go when there is no where to scroll but down? What are the consequences of writing interfaces shaped primarily by WEIRD writing practices? In other words, digital technologies are increasingly presumed to be “natural” and to be design in accordance with universal “human” tendencies in mind. For instance, despite the differences in local conditions and pedagogical approaches to teaching writing (Martins, 2015), university websites across the globe are remarkably similar in design, a topic further explored in the next chapter. It is in this vein that I argue that such an approach to global digital literacy is weird in the sense that it forecloses alternatives and aims to predetermine emerging digital cultures. 

In other words, the central argument of this book is that the dominant paradigm of global digital literacy is a digital literacy that is WEIRD & wired. That is to say, that many of the standards and genre defining qualities of digital texts are based around WEIRD contexts and through their global reach and, in part, galvanized through policy and pedagogical practices, these WEIRD ideologies become hardwired and work to enclose a digital (mono)literacy. Identifying the galvanizing tendencies of a global digital (mono)literacy is the first step to articulating an alternative.  

## Outline of the book

Including this introduction, there are six chapters to WEIRD & Wired. This book is explicitly born-digital and written with digital constraints in mind; the final portion of this introduction is a “Design Justification” that addresses the digital-materiality of this book. Starting with the premise that design choices are not innocent or free of bias and consequence, I justify my design choices based in a materialist understanding of digital work. This design justification acts as a foil to trends that the born-digital texts are often entranced by the “incorporeal” allure of digital writing or how writing can transcend the page, the word, and possibly even the machine (Edwards, 2020). 

The intention of this justification is not to villainize such designs; indeed, an entire generation of digital scholars have produced fascinating and innovative work that has made new knowledges transparent and useful. Rather, the intention of this section is to demonstrate an alternative that inspires born-digital writers to be accountable for their digital designs. Specifically, this design justification looks toward the bandwidth requirements for global accessibility. Toward this end, I justify the light-weightedness of this born-digital book. I discuss the technical processes of dithering images and how I have tried to compressed each chapter’s data footprint. 

I want to be clear: I am not arguing that broadband requirements are or should be the universally accepted and preeminent constraint for born-digital writers; rather, I contend that bandwidth requirements and the very material consequences of bandwidth requirements are a potential intersection where we might improve our digital scholarship and rethink the affordances and consequences of our work.

The following chapter, “WEIRD By Design” presents a framework for understanding and critiquing contemporary digital writing practices as WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic). Beginning with a survey of digital rhetoric and digital writing scholarship I argue that what counts as good digital writing is, from a global perspective, shaped heavily by WEIRD practices and values. Here I summarize cultural and educational concepts of WEIRD and I argue that our participation in these values continue to strengthen their hold. 

To build off this framework, I conduct an Activity Systems analysis of status quo digital design values across several global websites. I offer extended examinations of such values (e.g. opulence, user-data fetishization) coded into our web design practices like white space, CARP, UX, and digital expediency. In particular, these examinations demonstrate the sheer depth to which WEIRD values penetrate our digital writing practices. For instance, I examine the emergence of “white space” or “negative space” through a cultural material analysis that takes into account emerging technologies, mid-century design values, and consumptive practices. Concluding the chapter, I suggest a model of using this framework to identify and revise digital values against the grain of digital monoculture.

The next chapter, “Wired By Extension”, begins with a history of digital writing technologies. In contrast to analog writing technologies which are a subtractive practice, digital writing technologies imply an infinitive additive practice. Such additive practice can take the form of endlessly scrolling websites, additional movement in dimensions such as time (Norman, 2001), or the careful calculus of “gains and losses” (Prior, 2005). Rather than thinking of digital writing technologies as extensions of previous technology (Baron, 2009) this chapter contends that digital writing technologies merely extend WEIRD design ideologies by naturalizing the interfaces (Selfe & Selfe, 1994; Emerson, 2014; Harwood, 2016). In this way, the chapter examines how ideologies become hard(wired) when the materials, software, and institutions galvanize these very communication practices. 

In particular, this chapter touches on information architecture, digital writing technologies, and digital literacy polices to establish three emergent forms that wire our WEIRD practices. These are, respectively, a rationalist bias toward control and enclosure, a functionalist bias of achievement and results, and an economic bias toward participation/exploitation. Finally, this chapter concludes with a call to reclaim the subtractive nature of writing through the concept of leakage. Leakage is drawn from electronics and computer examples of “electrical leak” and “data leak” to imply places where a seemingly closed system trickle into their environment (or where the environment trickles into the system). To put it plainly, I suggest rather than focus on how technology enables and constrains us we should, instead, focus on how technology extracts from us and leaks into us.

The following chapter, “Tracing the Leakage: Polices, Pedagogies, and Practice ” gives three analysis of leakage framework. This chapter fleshes out the concept of leakage. Similar to Davis’s (2020) mechanisms and conditions approach to affordances, I outline the conditions under which leakages happen and the mechanisms for how leakages occur. After establishing this framework, I conduct an analyses using this leakage framework. First I examine several Digital Literacy Initiatives that frame Digital Literacy as an emerging lingua franca. In particular, I analyze initiatives that dovetail with the United Nations Roadmap For Digital Cooperation - an ambitious international policy that aspires to connect every adult on the planet with accessible and affordable internet access. While there is much to applaud in such an ambitious goal, I focus critiques toward primarily economic proposals (e.g. International Finance Corporation) in sub-saharan Africa. Such initiatives suggest and offer wide-scale digital adoption but often imply cultural adaption. Here, in particular, I demonstrate how the WEIRD and wired values of digital hegemony actively leak into transcontinental contexts. 

Following this policy analysis, this chapter provides an analysis of digital literacy pedagogies in Non-Western institutions. Such an analysis demonstrates the oversaturation of Western design values embedded in the de facto global audiences that emergent designers seek to reach. In this way, digitally literate in a global setting often implies adaptation to WEIRD audiences. I am not suggesting that such adaptation is entirely non-critical or non-agentive, even as local practices reinscribe global expectations the practices are inherently changed and give potential for pushback. 

Finally, drawing off previous fieldwork, this chapter offers an analysis of design practices for emerging digital professionals and, especially, their relationships with software tools. For many, these tools offer convenient and semi-automated workflows that quickly replicate dominant paradigms while freeing the writer to take on additional labor or spend time on other elements. 

The next chapter “Toward Vigilant Justification” further operationalizes the WEIRD and Wired framework. In particular, I argue that a disposition of vigilant design justification through self-critique of our work and our assumptions enables better articulation of the limits of our design or the limits of our desire to press forward. In other words, standard designs that aim to recreate digital (mono)culture should require intense justification: do we lack the will to push beyond the limits?; do we lack the technical savvy?; or does the value of our content imply adherence to the standards? Through such an exploration I articulate policy recommendations and pedagogical implications based on the framework. Specifically, I offer examples of pedagogical justification assignments, editorial justification recommendations, and 

The final chapter, “Afterword” concludes the book by looking toward the future of digital writing post WEIRD & Wired and reflects, especially, on new changes and challenges. At the time of this writing, it’s difficult to assume what these digital futures will be. At the top of my mind I imagine that the future of digital literacy is increasingly tied to the future of A.I. and, especially, the enclosure of digital artifacts within Apps. Increasingly, even the most mundane websites are funneling their users into phone and tablet Apps rather than web browsers. Extraction of user data and surveillance are compounded across such apps and design features trend toward heavily toward consumption.

What I hope to demonstrate across the arguments in this book are the many potential landscapes for intervening and shaping a global digital literacy that enables equitable and inclusive labor rights, cultural expression, and collective ownership of resources and knowledge domains. The next section points toward small ways I have hoped to foreground these potentials in the design of this book.  

## Design Justification For a Circuited Globe

On personal computers in our homes and workplaces, on shared devices at libraries and cafes, and on the ubiquitous mobile phones, people across the world are writing digitally. Underneath oceans and across continents, digital writing moves with, seemingly, little encumbrance. It is even with a sense of pride that we acknowledge the global reach of our digital academic essays; as an editorial statement in one journal proudly states such work is accessed by readers from “Ascension Island to Zimbabwe” (Kairos, 2023). In short, digital writing is a global phenomenon. 

But how often does the global audience for our digital writing inspire design choices? Undeniably, a globally-aware digital writer follows standards set by W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) and adherence to unicode is more often than not baked-in at the software level. Of course, the very layout of our digital writing (e.g. webtexts and webpages) is more often than not structured in lockstep with the familiar design virtues that allow the visual form (i.e. user-interface) to disappear through extreme usability (usability for whom, of course, is left open to interpretation). Nevertheless a pantheon of additional global issues remain below the surface and left unaddressed. 

For starters, file size and required bandwidth for many of our field’s contemporary digital publications approach levels of opulence. Multimedia such as images, podcasts, and videos are rarely delivered in any format short of the highest-possible quality. These high-fidelity media are then, due to various constraints, hosted, streamed, and thoroughly enclosed by an outside for-profit service (i.e. YouTube). These expectations also trickle into our classroom pedagogies. On the campuses and media suites where I’ve worked, staff are more than willing to funnel video projects into Youtube. The frictionless ability to freely stream high-quality content occludes questions like: should we drive traffic to a service that platforms and funnels users into alt-right content (Basu, 2020)?; and, does the quality justify the carbon footprint (Makonin, et. al., 2022)? To be blunt: the production standards of digital writing supercede the hidden, and often material, considerations for many across the world. 

For context, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) of the United States of America estimates that 5.3 billion people use the internet, roughly 66% of the worldwide population. China and India lead global usage with 854 and 560 million users, respectively, or a combined 1.4 billion. The US trails behind with 312 million users ahead of Indonesia, Brazil, Nigeria, Japan, Russia, Bangladesh, and Mexico rounding out the top ten. Despite the global saturation, digital traffic is so unencumbered that the top 5 highest traffic websites (Google, Youtube, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter) originate from the US (CITE). This disparity is striking yet unsurprising. It is a striking realization because anytime ~17% of a user base commands such a powerful presence on access to information it suggests there is more to be seen. Yet, unsurprising because colonial super-powers have always monopolized the flows of commerce and information.   

But access, in and of itself, only paints a small part of the picture. Some access is faster than others and some access is more open than others. What value is merely having “access” when enlarged files and slow download speeds render portions of the internet unusable? For instance, in  Zimbabwe over 90% of users with access to the internet are accessing websites with speeds below 10mbits (roughly 1.2 mbs/sec) with over 60% with speeds below 2mBits.

The status-quo from the heart of the digital empire has increasingly been to design maximally and build bigger websites. What I hope to suggest in the design of this text is an alternative.  Mine is a design minimalist agenda. To put it simply, to enact design justice will require design justification.

### Design Features

There are several design features I’d like to justify in the production and eventual display of this book. As a design choice, I have foregrounded low-energy and low-bandwidth design choices in order to increase the sustainability and accessibility of this text. I have taken inspiration from the solar powered website by Low-Tech Magazine and have used portions of their open-source code as testing grounds for this project. 

Because I am in a discipline that privileges textual production, I will start by justifying the text technologies used herein. This book is written in plain-text using the open-source language Markdown. There are several affordances of Markdown that have drawn me toward the language in the production of this book. First, Markdown is a “lightweight markup language”– by this I mean that the content is written in plain-text with simplified syntax. Secondly, the simplification of Markdown offers futureproofing. No proprietary software or user login is needed to open or edit a Markdown file. Such flexibility has enabled me to draft and edit across multiple devices and enabled me to occasionally unplug from my internet connection to achieve something of a “distraction free” writing environment. Finally, Markdown interfaces seamlessly with several wide-spread and open-source languages which enable the final version of this text to be generated using a static-site generator (e.g. Jekyll, Astro, Hugo).  

Continuing the discussion of the text, I would like to discuss the textual display. Each chapter is a separate page that can be read online and navigated through the use of hyperlinks. Additionally, each chapter can be downloaded individually as a PDF. By default, each PDF is typeset to an 8’x10’ frame to comfortably accommodate both A4 and Letter sized printing. A PDF sprite is used next to each chapter in the table of contents to indicate this. There are two reasons why I have included downloadable PDFs. First, despite the ever present feelings of “always-online” that many of us likely feel, electricity and broadband connections vary in reliability across the globe. Second, this serves to acknowledge how secondary systems of circulation exist outside of the digital interfaces and at times may even be a preference. For instance, even within the digitally rich US University system, I still have colleagues that print and annotate articles to share with me. 

Next, I’d like to speak about the visual aspects of this work. Throughout this book you’ll notice that the images are dithered. This process allows older displays to render the image more “accurately” and has enabled me to limit the file size of each image. For instance, in the image above I was able to cut the file size down to a third of the original through the process of dithering. In this current PROPOSAL DRAFT I have dithered the images with a simple open-source web app, Dither It!, in final production a server-side plug-in will be used in order to process images more efficiently.
 
Globally aware design features are not a sign of hubris or a promise that a text will globally circulate.
